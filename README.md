# 2020Moonhack

Moonhack is a free international event bringing together kids from across the world for a week of coding!

In 2020, we’re bringing Moonhack back to earth and into your home. Get together with your friends, download the step-by-step instructions, and code your own planet-saving solution.

Code your own planet-saving solution to water usage, to bush regeneration, to sustainability at home and more. Let’s save our planet, one project at a time!

This year, our Youth Coding and Innovation Club host this event (affiliate with Code Club Global), and five students present seven projects.
